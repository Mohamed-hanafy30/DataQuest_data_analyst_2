## Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets.
We're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers 
to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build. 

At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, 
and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly 
influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand 
what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.


### Data sets

- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play. You can download the data set directly from [this link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv).
- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) containing data about approximately seven thousand iOS apps from the App Store. You can download the data set directly from [this link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv).



### Conclusions

In this project, we analyzed data about the App Store and Google Play mobile apps with the goal of recommending an app profile
 that can be profitable for both markets.

We concluded that taking a popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable
for both the Google Play and the App Store markets. The markets are already full of libraries, so we need to add some special 
features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, 
a forum where people can discuss the book, etc.
